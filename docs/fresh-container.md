# A stranger runs the two commands

Recorded 2026-09-23 from a fresh `debian:13` container with only `git`, `jq`, `python3` and `python3-pytest` installed, cloning this repository and the tool's at the commits shown and running the commands both READMEs give. Nothing else was on the machine. The transcript is what the container printed.
